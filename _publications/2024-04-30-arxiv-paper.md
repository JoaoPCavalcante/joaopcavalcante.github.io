We propose a relation the expansions of regular and irregular semiclassical conformal blocks at different branch points making use of the connection between the accessory parameters of the BPZ decoupling equations 
to the logarithm derivative of isomonodromic tau functions. We give support for these relations by considering two eigenvalue problems for the confluent Heun equations obtained from the linearized perturbation theory of black 
holes. We first derive the large frequency expansion of the spheroidal equations, and then compare numerically the excited quasi-normal mode spectrum for the Schwarzschild case obtained from the large frequency expansion to the 
one obtained from the low frequency expansion and with the literature, indicating that the relations hold generically in the complex modulus plane.
