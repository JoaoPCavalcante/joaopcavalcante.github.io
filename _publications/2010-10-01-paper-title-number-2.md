We conduct an analysis of the quasinormal modes for generic spin perturbations of the Kerr black hole using the isomonodromic method. The strategy consists of solving the Riemann-Hilbert map relating the accessory parameters of the differential equations involved to monodromy properties of the solutions, using the τ-function for the Painlevé V transcendent. We show excellent accordance of the method with the literature for generic rotation parameter a<M. In the extremal limit, we determined the dependence of the modes with the black hole temperature and establish that the extremal values of the modes are obtainable from the Painlevé V and III transcendents.
